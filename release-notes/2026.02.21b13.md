Fix Config2 passcode authenticator derivation so encrypted passcode validation and updates use the correct Weave header fields.

## What changed
- Updated Config2 auth input to include `key_id` (`config + key_id + nonce + encrypted_block`) in `passcode_crypto.py`.
- Added a unit test that verifies tampering `key_id` now invalidates authenticator checks.
- Kept the validation safety gate from `b12` (no unvalidated writes by default).

## Why
- OpenWeave includes `key_id` in the Config2 authenticator input.
- Our previous implementation omitted `key_id`, which caused false validation failures and could produce ciphertext that Nest accepted but did not remain usable as a passcode.

## Tester notes
- Re-test `nest_yale_lock.set_guest_passcode` for an existing guest slot.
- If validation still fails, capture logs around `Resolved ApplicationKeysTrait` and `Passcode root material candidate` for next-step key-source analysis.
