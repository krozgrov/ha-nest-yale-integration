Improve passcode key discovery by merging ApplicationKeysTrait from lock, structure, and related device sources.

- Expand `ApplicationKeysTrait` retention to include non-lock `DEVICE_*` resources (for key derivation only).
- Merge all decoded ApplicationKeys entries for each resource instead of taking only the first decode.
- Include additional ApplicationKeys sources during passcode key-resolution fallback.
- Reduce debug log flood by capping per-attempt validation-mismatch lines and emitting a suppression summary.
- Keep strict passcode safety gate: updates still abort when no validated key material matches existing encrypted pincodes.
