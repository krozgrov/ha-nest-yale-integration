Fail fast on missing root key material by disabling unsafe default client-root probing from ApplicationKeysTrait 32-byte blobs.

- Treat `ApplicationKeysTrait` as epoch/master-key input only for passcode derivation unless explicitly overridden.
- Gate legacy client-root probing behind `NEST_YALE_ALLOW_APPKEYS_CLIENT_ROOT_CANDIDATES=1` for controlled debugging.
- Restrict `candidate_keys_32` usage as master-key fallback to decode-failure cases (when `master_keys` decoding yields none).
- Preserve strict validated-only passcode writes by default (`NEST_YALE_ALLOW_UNVALIDATED_PASSCODE_MATERIAL` still required to force unsafe attempts).
- Update docs and project logs to reflect the new default behavior and required env vars for root-key material.
