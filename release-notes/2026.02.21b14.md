Re-align Config2 passcode authenticator behavior with OpenWeave so encrypted-passcode validation uses the correct header fields.

## What changed
- Reverted Config2 authenticator input to OpenWeave behavior: `config + nonce + encrypted_block` (key_id excluded).
- Added regression test coverage for OpenWeave static Config2 vectors.
- Kept b12 safety behavior: unvalidated passcode writes are still blocked by default.

## Why
- Source verification against `openweave-core/src/lib/profiles/security/WeavePasscodes.cpp` shows key_id is not included in authenticator HMAC input.
- Including key_id in the auth input causes universal validation mismatch against existing lock pincodes.

## Tester notes
- Re-test `nest_yale_lock.set_guest_passcode`.
- If validation still fails with all candidates rejected, the account likely does not expose usable client-root/fabric material in observed traits; use explicit key material env vars to proceed safely.
