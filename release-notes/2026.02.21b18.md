Expand passcode key discovery to include all observed auth-trait payloads before validation.

- Parse and retain candidate key blobs from non-`ApplicationKeysTrait` `weave.trait.auth.*` payloads on lock/structure resources.
- Merge those auth-trait candidates with `ApplicationKeysTrait` candidates for passcode validation/encryption attempts.
- Keep strict safety behavior: updates still abort unless at least one candidate validates (unless `NEST_YALE_ALLOW_UNVALIDATED_PASSCODE_MATERIAL=1` is explicitly set).
- Update manifest/README/decision and execution logs for `2026.02.21b18`.
