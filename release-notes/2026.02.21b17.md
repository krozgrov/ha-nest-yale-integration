Restore validated client-root candidate probing by default to avoid premature "missing key material" aborts.

- Re-enable probing of discovered 32-byte `ApplicationKeysTrait` candidates as possible client-root inputs by default.
- Keep strict safety behavior: passcode writes still require validation against existing encrypted pincodes unless `NEST_YALE_ALLOW_UNVALIDATED_PASSCODE_MATERIAL=1` is explicitly set.
- Add explicit probe opt-out via `NEST_YALE_ALLOW_APPKEYS_CLIENT_ROOT_CANDIDATES=0`.
- Preserve tightened master-key fallback behavior: `candidate_keys_32` is only used as master-key fallback when decoded `master_keys` are unavailable.
- Update README, execution plan, and decision log to match the revised default behavior.
