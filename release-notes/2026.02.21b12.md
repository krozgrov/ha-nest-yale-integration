Prevent unvalidated passcode encryption writes so mismatched key material cannot silently clear Nest app passcodes.

## What changed
- `set_guest_passcode` now aborts by default when no key candidate validates against existing encrypted pincodes.
- Added explicit debug-only override: `NEST_YALE_ALLOW_UNVALIDATED_PASSCODE_MATERIAL=1`.
- Updated docs to explain the safety behavior and override.

## Why
- Some accounts expose `ApplicationKeysTrait` data that is insufficient to derive the correct client root key.
- Proceeding with unvalidated encryption in those cases can write unusable ciphertext and clear passcodes in Nest UI.

## Tester notes
- Leave `NEST_YALE_ALLOW_UNVALIDATED_PASSCODE_MATERIAL` unset for normal testing.
- If passcode updates now fail with a validation error, that is expected protective behavior.
