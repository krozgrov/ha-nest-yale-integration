# Google Nest x Yale Lock Integration for Home Assistant

**Custom Home Assistant integration for Google Nest x Yale Locks.**  
This integration enables basic monitoring and limited control of Nest x Yale smart locks within Home Assistant.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Real-time Yale lock state via Nest Observe stream
- Manual lock / unlock commands
- Serial number, firmware, and basic diagnostics attributes 

---

## 🚧 Beta Status

> ⚠️ **Heads-up: this integration is in beta and still under active development.**

The core lock and unlock commands are now working, and real-time state updates are generally reliable.  
However, the integration still depends on partially reversed protobuf messages taken from the [Homebridge Nest Plugin](https://github.com/chrisjshull/homebridge-nest), so gaps remain and rough edges are expected.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Logs may show `DecodeError in StreamBody: Error parsing message with type 'nest.rpc.StreamBody'` due to incomplete protobuf decoding. This is **harmless** and does not affect functionality.
- Additional message types beyond the basic lock trait are unmapped, limiting advanced diagnostics and telemetry.
- API response formats and authentication flows may change, potentially causing breaking updates.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

You can install the **Google Nest x Yale Lock** integration either via **HACS** or by **manual copy**.

---

### 🧩 Option 1 — Install via HACS (Recommended)

1. **Add the Custom Repository**
   - In Home Assistant, open **HACS → Integrations → ⋮ (three dots) → Custom Repositories**.
   - Add the repository URL:
     ```
     https://github.com/krozgrov/ha-nest-yale-integration
     ```
   - Select **Integration** as the category and click **Add**.

2. **Install the Integration**
   - Search for **Nest Yale Lock** in HACS and click **Download**.
   - Once installed, restart Home Assistant.

---

### 📁 Option 2 — Manual Installation

1. Copy the custom component folder into your Home Assistant configuration directory:
2. Restart Home Assistant to load the integration.

---

### ⚙️ Configuration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Google Nest x Yale Lock**.
2. Provide:
- **Issue token URL** – the `iframerpc?action=issueToken` URL captured from your Nest web session.
- **Cookies** – the raw cookie header string copied from your browser (e.g.  
  `__Secure-3PSID=…; __Host-3PLSID=…`).
3. Complete the setup wizard.

The integration will automatically reuse the same headers and protobuf payloads as the standalone test client.

---

### ✅ Verify Installation

After onboarding:
- Ensure the lock entity appears under **Devices & Services**.
- Test operation using:
- `lock.lock`
- `lock.unlock`
service calls.
